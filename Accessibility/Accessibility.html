  <h1> Leaders & Best - An Accessbility Review</h1>
  <p> I am providing an accessibility review for the <a href="https://leadersandbest.umich.edu">Leaders & Best</a> website. Please see below for all details.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Run through each page with the WAVE Chrome Extension. - FAIL</strong></li>
      <p>They have 7 errors found using the WAVE tool. Many of these are simple fixes. 5 of the errors are for missing alt tags on images on the home page. There are 2 errors for not having a descriptive text for two buttons. These are very simple and easy to fix errors, I would suggesting adding these in.</p>
    <li><strong>Users should be able to navigate through content using their keyboard. - FAIL</strong></li>
    <p>It appears that tabbing only allows you to go through the bottom links present in the footer. A visitor is unable to tab through other content on the page. At minimum, a visitor should be able to tab through the top level navigation to get to other pages. For all of the main content on the page, it is impossible to get there via tabbing.</p>
    <li><strong>Users should be able to navigate content using a screen reader. - FAIL </strong></li>
    <p>It is very difficult to use Voice Over to navigate the home page of Leaders & Best. As you hover over the top navigation, for instance, it doesn’t allow you to Tab to get information about what content you are on. As you do tab through, all it tells you is that you are on “Web Content” instead of giving useful information about what that content is. This needs to be re-done to have a more meaningful experience if you are using a screen reader tool. For instance, when a visitor is on Facebook and uses tab, the voice over tool easily reads out the actual content of whatever it is tabbed on. This page should at least do that with the major portions of the site.</p>
    <li><strong>The general architecture and hierarchy of the content should make sense. - FAIL</strong></li>
    <p>At least on the home page, there is only one header (H1) so there are no issues here with headers being out of order.
There does appear to be 7 low contrast errors, most of which are occuring in the top nav bar. One suggestion here to fix this is instead of having a striped background and white text, use a dark blue background and white text.</p>

    <li><strong>Charts and images should all have alt-text so that users with screen readers or users on a slow connection will still be able to understand the images. - FAIL</strong></li>
    <li>Decorative images should not be visible to screen readers.</li>
    <p> There are five images with no alt text as mentioned earlier.</p>
    <li><strong>Decorative images should not be visible to screen readers. - PASS </strong></li>
    <p>I found no errors here.</p>
  </ul>
